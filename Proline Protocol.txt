Proline Quantification Protocol

Parveen and Siddiqui, (2021) method for the determination of Proline content was followed.
200mg of fresh leaves and root material was homogenized in 3ml of 3% sulphosalicylic acid
and then kept overnight at 5ยบ C. The suspension was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes.
After centrifugation, acidic ninhydrin was added to 2ml of the supernatant in test tubes. The
test tubes were then heated in water bath at 100ยบ C for 1 hr. After that, the mixture was cooled,
and the cooled mixture was extracted with 4ml toluene using a separate funnel. Toluene was
used as blank and Optical density was observed at 520nm against blank using
spectrophotometer (SPECORD 200 Plus). The preparation of acid ninhydrin reagent was
carried out by mixing 1.25 g of ninhydrin in 20 ml of 6M phosphoric acid and 30 ml of glacial
acetic acid with agitation, until dissolved. This reagent can remain stable for at least 24 hrs.
For standard curve, different L-PROLINE concentrations were used.
